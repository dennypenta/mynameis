## What is it 

I would recomment it for reading only if:
- You look for programming some technical, but out of ideas
- You are tech indie hacker who might look for a person to discuss ideas, brainstorm or even build a team (with me if you didn't get it)


On this page I want to document the projects ideas I keep in my head, some of them for a very long time, some since recently. 
The document probably will be updated time to time, but the idea to me simply not to loose the track of what I have.

I hope I can implement at least half of them by the end of my software career.

### 0: Failed grpc gui

It's actually one I partially implemented, a grpc gui that gives a full scripting capability.

I realized scripting itself doesn't give much value and gave up.
But recently I found how to capitalize it and make something cool.
Projects like cycpres allows generating e2e tests by clicking UI elements, it tracks events, generates code so you could run the same scenario constantly
What if we could track all the API calls on backend then generate code?
Sounds cool, I can click staging and expect it will be reproducable.
Also, I can copy this code to make a manual scenario without expecting same result, just test something that takes many clicking.

Failed repo is there btw: https://github.com/kalisto-application/kalisto

### 1: PaaS as code

That's my current thing. Idea is huge and the amount of features I want to do is huge.
The list is long.

1) It creates an abstraction on top of k8s so any kid could deploy an app and keep playing with kube. 
As a result it fits small teams and mid/large project could potentially consider it, that's why exactly kube, no VM or Nomad.

2) Infra provision, eventually a user requests a database and its credentials are provided to the app envs, so one can just know it exists and don't configure it.
Ideally an engineer even without requesting a db just call in the app `db := tq.NewDB()` and it works. 
In a similar manner works encore.dev (but creates a huge level of abstraction and a custom runtime) or sst.dev.

3) Observability exists. You don't configure metrics, logging collection, you just have it giving a simple config. 
Yes, it's highly opinionated, but 0 effort. 
I even have udnerstanding how to do it. Either ebpf or service mesh. 
For instance, Istio provides gateway based metrics and can map the routes to different metrics. Theoretically I can integrate a given openapi and service mesh and the metrics are done.

4) Telepresence or mirrord is integrated. It means you can run a service locally and never deal with config files and local docker compose setups. 
You just run it against staging environment, zero config, it works.

5) Optionally: preview is integrated.
For some features a team may want to preview it, so create a temporary environment with a flexible deployment.
The feature is easy to do for stateles systems like frontend applications, but branching a database is a huge challenge.
Neon makes it spossible for postgres today, planetscale for mysql, but there are plenty more storages we have.

6) Tilt.dev is integrated. It means you cal run locally `docker build` and this image is immediately on staging. 
Imagine how fast if feedback loop when you test changes with the team together right in the moment.

### 2: Go framework that doesn't suck

Framework sounds huge. 
But heaer me out, I don't want to build another route or faster router.
Once I looked at huma.rocks and it looked very solid at what it does.

Idea: 
- you don't write monkey code on marshalling and unmarshalling body, just start from a business layer
- you don't write API client to communicate to your API, it just exists (code gen hello)
- you don't describe openAPI for the service, it exists

The last point is huge to me. 
Instead of writing openAPI and having lots of time lost on "why it doesn't fit spec" the API is ran by implementation first.
You see in the spec what you implemented, not what you promised. 

As a cost it may limit how flexible is the API, but Im fine.
I hate REST.
I prefer building web APIs.
And a web API is ok if it has only GET or POST apis and has every request argument body as a request body.
It's similar to json rpc, but simpler.

I already started working on it in my PaaS project and test it in the battle, seems good so far. 
But I will opensource it as soon as PaaS fails and will continue using this framework as long as it helps me moving faster for projects where I need Go.

### 3: Infra provision for Go that doesn't suck

Remember this part from PaaS `db := tq.NewDB()`.
I think it's real.
To make something similar to encore.dev, but not dependent on runtime.
Sounds to me as pulumi + sync with state (let's say S3).
Result is the same, you don't have a config, you don't have secret management, explicit provision.
The only issue is managing the state and its secret, it might be a big security issue.

### 3: Write opensource Mongodb optimized for log storage or e-comm.

As of today Mongodb is not opensourced.
There is an attempt to replace it, very successful I would save, ferretdb.
They have good support from Microsoft and somebody else, but it's on top of postgres.

Don't get me wrong, postgres is great.
But I think there are caveats of building it on top of existing db.

What if write it in Zig? 
The performance must be huge, in a very accurate memory management it's even better than Rust.

### 4: Auth for Go that doesn't suck.

There are lots of auth projects around one can run as a separate service: Logto, keycloak, zitadel, supabase, there are too many of them.
But most of the time to make it simple and fast it's great to run an embedded package instead of configuring another service.
There are a couple librarie for go: goth and authboss.
First is just oauth client, it's great to even look for a code and copy to the project.
Second seems huge to implement everything, but documentation sucks.

But there is one very interesting project: Ory Kratos.
If anyone tells it's a security concern to run it in the same process - send them away.
Even the kratos owners run it as embedded package in SaaS offering.
Would be great to reinvent kratos as embedding first solution and make it well documented.

There is a similar one for typescript - simple auth.
The only scaring thing - both projects are between 50-100k LoC.
