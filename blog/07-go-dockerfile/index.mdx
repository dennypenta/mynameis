## Preface

TLDR:

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.23.1-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app

ENV CGO_ENABLED=0 
ENV GOOS=linux

COPY go.mod go.mod
COPY go.sum go.sum
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/go/pkg/mod/ go mod download -x

COPY . .

FROM builder AS dev

RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/go/pkg/mod/ --mount=type=cache,target="/root/.cache/go-build" go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@v1.23.0

RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/go/pkg/mod/ --mount=type=cache,target="/root/.cache/go-build" go build -gcflags=all="-N -l" -o server ./cmd/server

CMD ["dlv", "--listen=:40000", "--continue", "--headless=true", "--api-version=2", "--accept-multiclient", "exec", "server"]

FROM builder AS prod

RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/go/pkg/mod/ --mount=type=cache,target="/root/.cache/go-build" go build -ldflags "-s -w" -o server ./cmd/server

FROM alpine:3.13

RUN addgroup -g 1001 appgroup && adduser -D -G appgroup -u 1001 appuser

WORKDIR /app

USER 1001

COPY --from=prod /app/server server

CMD ["/app/server"]
```

Now let's breakdown what's happening here and why.

__Note__: I use colima and all the things described here work well. However, all the docs referenses will go to docker. I think they did a great job to push the industry standart. Also you have to turn on buildx to make these features work. It requires buildx installation and setting a feature flag `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`.

## Base image

First, we need a base image in order to build the app. We want the base being less as possible, for that purpose I use alpine:

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.23.1-alpine AS builder
```

You also can consider [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless), it's very suitable for interpreted languages like python/nodejs, but alpine works well for Go.

## Dependencies

The next step we prepare a surface to build the image, all the necessary dependencies we install there.

If you need specific timezones, certificates, github private repo creds, the service modules, whatever, we do it right here.

```dockerfile
COPY go.mod go.mod
COPY go.sum go.sum
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/go/pkg/mod/ go mod download -x
```

We must copy only desegnated dependencies definition and right after download them.
If you don't know why and what is docker layers please refer to Docker basics and get back.

`-x` Flag is kinda adds verbosity showing what `go mod download` executes.

The interesting details here is `--mount=type=cache`.
You can find more in the [reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#run---mounttypecache)

If you update a dependency in your `go.mod` and rebuild it, then this statement will not download all the packages from scratch, it creates a designated mount and hold them in one place.

Unfortunately, most of the CI systems create a new image for a new job and it doesn't work in CI, but helps a lot for local testing. For instance, I run e2e tests locally and it saves a couple of minutes every try.

And only then we copy the rest of the codebase:

```dockerfile
COPY . .
```

__Note__: Don't forget to check your dockerignore to skip copying useless files.

## Targets

You must have heard about multi-stage images.
And you have built the dockerfiles with 2 stages, first to build a binary and the next to run it in a blank environment.

But I will convince you to have 4 stages.

Docker has an amazing feature: targets.

The targets allow to run a specified stage of the image.

Let's have a look how it plays out in case of e2e tests.

We have a regular docker compose setup with a database or whatever dependencies you have to run your tests.
Im a big fan of a debugger and a big hater of infinite print statements. Don't get me wrong, logging is an awesome tool, but not the forgotten prints in a production build.

```dockerfile
FROM builder AS dev

RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/go/pkg/mod/ --mount=type=cache,target="/root/.cache/go-build" go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@v1.23.0

RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/go/pkg/mod/ --mount=type=cache,target="/root/.cache/go-build" go build -gcflags=all="-N -l" -o server ./cmd/server

CMD ["dlv", "--listen=:40000", "--continue", "--headless=true", "--api-version=2", "--accept-multiclient", "exec", "server"]
```

On installing delve don't forget to specify cache mount, it has its own dependencies and it will help to speed the build up.
Moreover, if you don't mount the cache it won't discover the installeed dependencies in a previous step.

The mount flag might look unclear, as an argument you only put a path _where_ to mount, you can't control the source of directory, it's managed docker buildkit.

Then we build a binary with a couple important gcflags, where `-l` disables inlining and `-N` removes optimisations. It matters because otherwise debugger won't be able to show some variables or navigate into some functions.
You can read more [here](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/compile).

As the last statement we run dlv.

And that's what we have in a docker compose:

```yaml
server:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
    target: dev
  ports:
    - '8000:8000'
    - '40000:40000'
  security_opt:
    - seccomp:unconfined
  cap_add:
    - SYS_PTRACE
```

Here we specify target field, clear and simple. You also can pass it as a cli argument to an image.

Ports has 2 elements, a regular app HTTP port and a DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol) port that delve exposes.

Next we add `secuty_opt` since the default Seccomp profile restricts the `ptrace` system call.

__Note__: Seccomp is a Linux kernel feature used to restrict the system calls that a process can make. By default, Docker applies a restrictive Seccomp profile to limit potentially dangerous system calls, improving container security. Read more [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/) and [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/containers/run/).

When you specify `seccomp:unconfined`, it removes the Seccomp restrictions, allowing the container to make all system calls. This config allows running `ptrace` syscall in the container, delve uses it to set breakpoints, observe memory, etc.

But it's not enough. We have to not only remove a restriction, but explicitly give a permission, that's why we have `cap_add` statement: to add a capability for that syscall.

## Build prod

The prod build is quite simple and well known:

```dockerfile
FROM builder AS prod

RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/go/pkg/mod/ --mount=type=cache,target="/root/.cache/go-build" go build -ldflags "-s -w" -o server ./cmd/server
```

We still use mount cache, we just put different build flags, in this case ldflags to achieve exactly the opposite we did in order to build a debug target.
`-s` and `-w` stand for skipping debug info, read more [here](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/link).

## Run prod

There is no lots of new things for you, I want to focus on a small important thing: a user.

```dockerfile
RUN addgroup -g 1001 appgroup && adduser -D -G appgroup -u 1001 appuser

USER 1001
```

There is so many information around on this security topic and I keep seeing zero attention to a user inside the image.

Shortly speaking - less ability less chance to make a mistake or open a vulnerability. Docker has a good blog [post](https://www.docker.com/blog/understanding-the-docker-user-instruction/) to cover why it matters.

## Target dependenciy graph

Now about the main concern of so many stages.

Why would I build all the stages for releasing my go app?

You will not, if you turned on buildkit it will behave as a smarter and build only the necessary dependencies, it means it builds the dependency graph and builds only necessary part, so your production CI will never install delve to waste your time.
The [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/#differences-between-legacy-builder-and-buildkit) explains it very well.

## Conclusion

Sorry, have nothing to say. Appreciate if you leave things better than you found it.
